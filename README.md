## Problem
Specialized Individualized Education Plans (IEP) are crucial for children with special needs. Yet, in underserved areas, the dearth of experts hampers the formulation of effective IEPs, leaving many students without the tailored support they require.

## UN SDG Alignment
This project is aligned with UN SDG Goal 4: Quality Education, ensuring inclusive and equitable learning for all.

## Solution
Introducing the "IEP Co-Pilot" - an innovative application that harnesses the power of AI to democratize access to specialized education planning.

- **How it works:**
    - Teachers or guardians initiate the app during planning sessions with the student.
    - As conversations ensue, the app records, converts speech to text, and processes this information in real-time.
    - Leveraging techniques like prompt engineering, it collaborates with advanced language models, such as ChatGPT, to formulate a tailored IEP.

- **Unique Features:**
    - This draft IEP isn’t just a generic plan; it's tailored based on the nuances captured during the conversation.
    - Once generated, an educational assistant reviews, validates, and refines the plan.

By acting as a co-pilot, the app doesn’t replace human expertise but amplifies it, making specialized education more accessible. For underserved communities, this doesn’t just bridge a gap; it opens up a world of tailored educational possibilities for those who need it most.
